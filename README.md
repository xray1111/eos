eos is a tiny 3D Morphable Face Model fitting library that provides just the bare minimum to load a model and perform camera and shape fitting. It's written in modern C++11/14.

At the moment, it mainly provides the following functionality:

* MorphableModel class to represent a 3DMM (using OpenCVs `cv::Mat`)
* Camera pose estimation, implementation of:
  * the _Gold Standard Algorithm_ for estimating an affine camera matrix, from Multiple View Geometry, Hartley & Zisserman
  * a non-linear algorithm that directly estimates the pose angles and camera translation
* Shape fitting, implementation of the linear shape-to-landmarks fitting of O. Aldrian & W. Smith, _Inverse Rendering of Faces with a 3D Morphable Model_, PAMI 2013
* Isomap texture extraction to obtain a pose-invariant representation of the face texture.

## Usage

* Tested with the following compilers: >=gcc-4.8.4, >=clang-3.5, Visual Studio 2015
* Needed dependencies for the library: Boost system (>=1.50.0), OpenCV core (>=2.4.3)

To use the library in your own project, just add the following directories to your include path:

* `eos/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/cereal-1.1.1/include`
* `eos/3rdparty/glm-0.9.7.0`

### Build the examples and tests

* Needed dependencies for the example app: CMake (>=2.8.10), Boost system, filesystem, program_options (>=1.50.0), OpenCV core, imgproc, highgui (>=2.4.3).

To build:

* copy `initial_cache.cmake.template` to `initial_cache.cmake`, edit the necessary paths
* create a build directory next to the `eos` folder: `mkdir build; cd build`
* `cmake -C ../eos/initial_cache.cmake -G "<your favourite generator>" ../eos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/`
* build using your favourite tools, e.g. `make; make install` or open the solution in Visual Studio.


## Sample code

See [examples/fit-model.cpp](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp).

After `make install` or running the `INSTALL` target, an example image with landmarks can be found in `install/bin/data/`. The model and the necessary landmarks mapping file are installed to `install/share/`.

You can run the example just by running:

`fit-model`

Or, by manually specifying the face model, landmark vertex mappings, an image and its 2D landmarks:

`fit-model -m ../share/sfm_shape_3448.bin -p ../share/ibug2did.txt -i data/image_0010.png -l data/image_0010.pts`

The output is an `obj` file with the shape and a `png` with the extracted isomap. The estimated pose angles and shape coefficients are available in the code via the API.

## Documentation

Doxygen: http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/

The [fit-model example](https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos/blob/master/examples/fit-model.cpp) and the [Namespace List](http://patrikhuber.github.io/eos/doc/namespaces.html) in doxygen are a good place to start.
